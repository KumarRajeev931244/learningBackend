API stands for Application Programming Interface. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant. You (the user) tell the waiter (API) your order (request) and the waiter brings you the food (response) from the kitchen (server). APIs let different software talk to each other and share information, making the whole digital ecosystem work smoothly.
